  description: |+
    SIM Swap API provides the customer the ability to obtain information on any recent SIM pairing change
     related to the Userâ€™s mobile account. 

    The API provided 2 operations:

    - POST retrieve-date : provide timestamp of latest SIM swap,

    - POST check: check if SIM swap has been performed during a past period (defined in the request with 'age' attribute).
